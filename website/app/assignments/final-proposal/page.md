title: "Final Project: Proposal, Update, and Presentation"
excerpt: "Propose a substantial creative project using generative AI"
---

Due Dates:

- **November 25, 2025**: Final project proposal & proposal Presentation
- **December 2, 2025**: Progress update
- **Dedember 9, 2025**: Final project & presentation

## Overview

- For the final project, you will build a substantial creative project, composition, or artwork
  with help from generative AI. This should be a more ambitious and comprehensive project than
  your midterm, demonstrating deeper exploration of generative AI techniques and creative
  expression.

- You may continue working on your midterm project if you wish, but you must propose
  **significant additions and enhancements** that substantially expand the scope and ambition
  of the work. If continuing your midterm, your proposal must clearly articulate what new
  features, techniques, or creative directions you will add.

- The project can be a musical composition, musical production, video, artwork, interactive
  web page, instrument, or any other creative work that meaningfully incorporates generative AI.

- You will make two web pages: a proposal and a final project page. You will also deliver
  brief in-class proposal presentations and progress demos.

## Process

You will complete the work in three milestones. You have one week to complete the proposal,
one week to prepare an in-class presentation and show progress, and additional time to finish
and document the project.

### 1: Final Project Proposal

You have one week to complete the proposal and submit it via Pull Request (PR).

Create a page at `/students/your-name/final-proposal/`. Your page should document:

- What you would like to do
- HOW you will do it
- If continuing your midterm project:
  - A clear summary of what you accomplished in the midterm
  - Detailed description of the new features, techniques, or creative directions you will add
  - Explanation of how these additions substantially expand the project's scope and ambition
- If starting a new project:
  - How this project builds on or differs from your midterm
  - Why this project is more ambitious than the midterm
- Questions, concerns, and stretch goals

### 2: Final Proposal Presentation & Progress Update

Come to class prepared to present and discuss your proposal and demonstrate your progress.
You should be ready to discuss the bullets from section 1 above and demonstrate the progress
you have made.

### 3: Final Project

You will have additional time to complete your project and document your work in a web page
at `students/your-name/final-project`. The web page should **demonstrate the work** and describe:

- What you did
- How you used AI
- If continuing your midterm: what new features or enhancements you added and how they
  expanded the project
- Reflect on how AI changed your process. How do the results compare to a non-AI process?
- If you found the AI helpful or interesting to work with, explain why
- If you found the AI unhelpful or unpleasant to work with, explain why
- What you learned from this project and how it differs from your midterm experience

Come to class prepared to present and discuss your project and the bullets above.

Make sure the page clearly exposes your final result:

- If you created an audio file, ensure the page has an audio player (you can put the audio
  in the `public/students/your-name` folder like we did in one of the homeworks)
- If you created a video, make sure the page includes a video player (you can use a YouTube
  or Vimeo embed)
- If you created a physical project, your page should include images or video
- etc...

## Grading Rubric

- **5** PRs change only allowed directories (and `/public/students/your-name/` if needed)
- **10** The Proposal and Project pages have a single dedicated branch and PR
- **10** Correct filenames/structure (e.g., `/app/students/your-name/final-proposal/page.tsx`)

**Proposal**

- **10** Proposal: Your proposal page renders correctly on the web
- **15** Proposal: `final-proposal` page addresses all bullets in section **1: Final Project Proposal**
- **5** Proposal: If continuing midterm, clearly articulates substantial additions and enhancements

**Proposal Presentation & Progress Update**

- **15** You came to class ready to present, and gave a clear, concise presentation

**Final Project**

- **10** Your project page renders correctly on the web
- **20** `final-project` page addresses all bullets in section **3: Final Project**
- **15** Shows serious effort beyond midterm project (substantial additions if continuing, or
  significantly more ambitious scope if new project)
- **10** Documentation includes at least one image, video, musical score, or audio element
- **20** You came to class ready to present, and gave a clear, concise presentation
- **5** Clear reflection on how this project differs from or builds on the midterm experience
