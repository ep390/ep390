Due Dates:

- **October 14, 2025, 6pm**: Proposal due (no class; submit PR)
- **October 21, 2025, 6pm**: Proposal presentation and progress update
- **October 28, 2025, 6pm**: Final project due; in-class presentations

## Overview

- For the midterm, you will build a creative project, composition, or artwork
  with help from generative AI. It can be a musical composition, musical
  production, video, artwork, interactive web page, or instrument.

- If you do not have a specific project in mind, think about the assignments
  that we did. These used code generation, the Web MIDI API, and symbolic music
  notation. Each of these is a potential starting point for a larger, more
  ambitious creative project.

- You can also review
  [finalists in the AI Song Competition](https://www.aisongcontest.com/the-2024-finalists).
  Each finalist documents how they used AI in the process. Read through some of
  the pages, study the artists' process, and look for ideas.

- You will make two web pages: a proposal and a final project page. You will
  also deliver a brief in-class proposal presentation and progress demo.

## Process

You will complete the work in three milestones. You have one week to complete the
proposal, one week to prepare an in-class presentation and show progress, and one
additional week to finish and document the project.

### 1: Midterm Proposal

You have one week to complete the proposal and submit it via Pull Request (PR).

Create a page at `/students/your-name/midterm-proposal/`. Your page should document:

- What you would like to do
- HOW you will do it
- Questions, concerns, and stretch goals

### 2: Midterm Proposal Presentation & Progress Update

Come to class prepared to present and discuss your proposal and demonstrate your
progress. You should be ready to discuss the three bullets from section 1 above
and demonstrate the progress you have made.

### 3: Midterm Project

You have one additional week to complete your project and document your work in a web page at `students/your-name/midterm-project`. The web page should
**demonstrate the work** and describe:

- What you did
- How you used AI
- Reflect on how AI changed your process. How do the results compare to a non-AI process?
- If you found the AI helpful or interesting to work with, explain why
- If you found the AI unhelpful or unpleasant to work with, explain why

Come to class prepared to present and discuss your project and the bullets above.

Make sure the page clearly exposes your final result:

- If you created an audio file, ensure the page has an audio player (you can put the audio in the `public/students/your-name` folder like we did in one of the homeworks)
- If you created a video, make sure the page includes a video player (you can use a YouTube or Vimeo embed)
- If you created a physical project, your page should include images or video
- etc...

## Grading Rubric
