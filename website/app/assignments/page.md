## Submission Process

Generally, to submit homework assignments you will:

1. Create a new branch for your assignment. You can use GitHub Desktop or a command like `git checkout -b charles-hw1` in the terminal (but substitute the branch from `charles-hw1` to a suitable branch name)
1. Follow the instructions in the assignment, and commit your changes with `git`
1. Push, for example with `git push -u origin charles-hw1`
1. In GitHub make a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch
