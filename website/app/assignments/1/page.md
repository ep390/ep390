Let's create some pages in the class website. Over the course of the semester,
we will explore how far we can push AI to create increasingly elaborate content.
But first we will try a very simple example.

## What You'll Learn

- How to setup the class web **server** for development
- How to add a page to the website with a markdown file
- How to submit an assignment as a GitHub Pull Request (PR)

## Assignment

### 1. Setup the Web Server

Follow the instructions in [Getting Started](/modules/getting-started) to make
sure that the development server is running on your computer.

### 2. Create a tsx 

Creating a new branch is essential for submitting your homework correctly!

When starting work in a shared git repository always begin by creating a new git branch, for example

```bash
git checkout -b charles-hw1
```

You can also use GitHub Desktop if you do not want to use the Terminal.
Sustitute `charles-hw1` with a suitable branch name.

2. Create a new directory with your name and add a `page.md`, for example
   - [website/app/students/alice/page.md](https://github.com/ep390/ep390/blob/main/website/app/students/alice/page.md?plain=1)

### 3. Commit and Push to GitHub

TBD

### 4. Make a Pull Request

TBD

## Grading Rubric

- **10** Your pull request changed only files in the correct  directory (you may also modify the your subdirectory in the public folder, for example `website/public/students/alice/`)

- **10** You created a single branch dedicated only to the assignment
