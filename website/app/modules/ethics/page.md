title: Ethical Impacts of Generative AI
---

In the past, new technologies have shifted the balance of power between economic and cultural stakeholders.

This can hurt people socially and economically – and these negative effects can be exaggerated when technology is adopted quickly.

Generative AI technologies are changing fast now and we can already identify harm it has caused. We can also see ways that its benefits are distributed inequitably.

Below is an incomplete list of references and examples.

## Energy and Water

  - Cooling systems in data centers account for roughly 30% to 40% of total energy consumption.
  - Global data center energy consumption is expected to double by 2030

  - 1% of all global energy is consumed by data centers (2022)
  - Data centers are expected to use 1/5th of the world’s power supply by 2025.

  - A single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh,
  - 700 million GPT-4o queries/day results in:
    - Electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes
    - Freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people
    - Carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset
