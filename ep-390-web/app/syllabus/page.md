## Course Description

**AI Hype** is everywhere! Major tech companies are betting on AI and offering annual salaries in the hundreds of millions to AI researchers.

**AI Scorn** is everywhere too. Detractors point to the environmental costs, ethical implications, and technical limitations of generative AI.

So which is it? **Over-hyped purveyor of AI Slop?** Or **impending economic revolution** posing a real threat to artists, musicians, and anyone not poised to benefit from the success of major tech companies? **Can it be both?**
