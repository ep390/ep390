## Generative AI for Music, Code, and Image

- Semester: Fall 2025
- Time: Tuesdays 6-8pm
- Instructor: Charles Holbrow
- Instructor Email: cholbrow@berklee.edu
- Office Hours: TBD
- Course Chair: [Michele Darling](https://www.berklee.edu/people/michelle-darling)
- Administrative Coordinator - [Michelle Stockman](mailto:mstockman@berklee.edu)

## Course Description

**AI Hype** is everywhere! Major tech companies are betting on AI and offering annual salaries in the hundreds of millions to AI researchers.

**AI Scorn** is everywhere too. Detractors point to the environmental costs, ethical implications, and technical limitations of generative AI.

So which is it? **Over-hyped purveyor of AI Slop?** Or **impending economic revolution** posing a real threat to artists, musicians, and anyone not poised to benefit from the success of major tech companies? **Can it be both?**

Learn to see through the hype and make your own informed opinions about the utility, trajectory, and ethics of modern generative AI.

## Topic List

Each week will introduce a new topic, and work on an introductory lab exercise. Each exercise is an opportunity to build on further in the mid-term and final projects.

- Hands on: Tools for agentic code generation
- Hands on: Symbolic Music Generation
- Research Review: Can models “reason”?
- Ethics: TESCREAL
- Ethics: AI and the Environment
- **Mid-term project!**
- Theory: Transformers
- Theory and Practice: Music Generation
- Theory: Diffusion
- Theory and practice: Model internals and Comfy-UI
- Theory and practice: Image Gen – On-device and in the cloud
- Hands on: Video Games
- **Final project!**

AI is changing fast! The exact make-up of this list may change subtly to keep up with important developments in the field.

## Course Activities

In this class, you will:

- Get hands-on practice with modern tools for generating media
- Study how the models work under the hood
- Explore research and criticism of Generative AI
- Build a portfolio of content and reflections that expose AI strengths and weaknesses
- Develop an informed critical take on the utility and ethics of generative AI

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- **Demonstrate proficiency** with contemporary generative AI tools for creating music, code, and images
- **Analyze and explain** the fundamental technical principles underlying transformer and diffusion models
- **Critically evaluate** generative AI research papers and distinguish between hype and substantive claims
- **Assess** the environmental, ethical, and economic implications of generative AI deployment
- **Identify and articulate** pitfalls in Generative AI
- **Develop** well-reasoned perspectives on AI's role in creative industries

## Prerequisites

- We will be writing code, using the terminal, and submitting assignments on GitHub
- The class requires a B or better in LMSC-261 to enroll
- We will be using both Python and JavaScript – Comfort with at least one of these is required

## Preamble

Some contents of the curriculum may change in small ways based on our progress
throughout the semester and based on new and ongoing developments in the field.
The course policies, expectations, and grading metrics will not change.

## Expectations

All students are expected to

- Attend fourteen lectures
- Take a syllabus quiz
- Work on six laboratory exercises
- Present 1-2 research works
- Design and implement mid-term and final projects
- Participate in the mid-term and final project presentations

## Grading Criteria

## Bias towards Open Models

Currently, the best generative models are "closed weight," meaning that in order to access them you need to pay to use a model by sending a request to the model providers web-service.

Sometimes proprietary closed-source generative models are promoted for free.

**In this class we will prioritize free and open-weight models when possible and appropriate.**

We will **avoid** proprietary services like Suno that focus web based UIs.
