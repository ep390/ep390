# Welcome to the EP-390 Blog

This is a sample blog post written in Markdown to test the functionality we've ported from the blog starter app.

## Features

- Markdown file processing
- Front matter parsing
- Automatic blog post generation

## Getting Started

You can add new markdown files to the `_posts` directory and they will automatically be processed and displayed as blog posts.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello from EP-390!");
```

This demonstrates that code blocks work as well in our markdown processing.
